# Authentication and RBAC System Testing Plan

## Introduction
This document outlines a comprehensive testing plan for the authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. It covers all user roles, critical authentication scenarios, and authorization checks at both the API and UI levels.

## Test Environment Setup
1. Create test accounts for each role:
   - SUPERADMIN
   - ADMIN
   - SALES
   - USER
   - Any additional roles in the system
2. Create multiple test companies with different configurations
3. Configure test data for each company to support scenario testing

## Test Scenarios by Role

### 1. SUPERADMIN Testing

#### 1.1 Authentication
- [ ] Login successfully with SUPERADMIN credentials
- [ ] Verify session persists across page reloads
- [ ] Verify session persists after browser restart (with "remember me" option)
- [ ] Verify logout functionality properly clears session

#### 1.2 Company Selection
- [ ] Access the company selection dashboard
- [ ] Successfully switch between different companies
- [ ] Verify that the selected company context persists through navigation
- [ ] Verify that data shown is correctly scoped to the selected company

#### 1.3 Admin Panel Access
- [ ] Access all admin sections without permission errors
- [ ] Create, edit, and delete users within different company contexts
- [ ] Manage role assignments for users across companies
- [ ] Access system-wide settings and configurations

#### 1.4 Data Operations
- [ ] Create and edit transactions in any company context
- [ ] View reports across all companies
- [ ] Access audit logs and security events
- [ ] Execute advanced operations reserved for SUPERADMINs

### 2. ADMIN Testing

#### 2.1 Authentication
- [ ] Login successfully with ADMIN credentials
- [ ] Verify session persists across page reloads
- [ ] Verify session persists after browser restart
- [ ] Verify logout functionality properly clears session

#### 2.2 Company Context
- [ ] Verify ADMIN can only access their assigned company's data
- [ ] Attempt to access another company's data (should be forbidden)
- [ ] Verify the company selection page is not accessible

#### 2.3 Admin Functions
- [ ] Create and manage users within their company
- [ ] Assign roles to users within permitted roles
- [ ] Manage company settings and preferences
- [ ] Create, edit, and delete inventory items

#### 2.4 Data Access Boundaries
- [ ] Verify ability to view all transactions within their company
- [ ] Verify ability to create financial transactions
- [ ] Attempt to access SUPERADMIN-only endpoints (should fail)

### 3. SALES Role Testing

#### 3.1 Authentication
- [ ] Login successfully with SALES credentials
- [ ] Verify session persists across page reloads
- [ ] Verify session persists after browser restart
- [ ] Verify logout functionality properly clears session

#### 3.2 Sales Operations
- [ ] Access the sales dashboard
- [ ] Create new sales transactions
- [ ] View sales history and reports
- [ ] Access inventory items (read-only)

#### 3.3 Permission Boundaries
- [ ] Attempt to access admin sections (should be hidden/forbidden)
- [ ] Attempt to edit inventory (should be forbidden if not permitted)
- [ ] Attempt to access financial reports (should be forbidden if not permitted)

### 4. Basic USER Testing

#### 4.1 Authentication
- [ ] Login successfully with basic USER credentials
- [ ] Verify session persists across page reloads
- [ ] Verify session persists after browser restart
- [ ] Verify logout functionality properly clears session

#### 4.2 Basic Operations
- [ ] Access the basic dashboard
- [ ] View permitted reports
- [ ] Access their own user profile

#### 4.3 Permission Boundaries
- [ ] Attempt to access admin sections (should be hidden/forbidden)
- [ ] Attempt to access sales operations (should be hidden/forbidden if not permitted)
- [ ] Attempt to edit any data (should be forbidden unless specifically permitted)

## Cross-Cutting Test Scenarios

### 1. Session Management Tests
- [ ] Test session timeout behavior - verify redirection to login
- [ ] Test concurrent logins from multiple devices
- [ ] Test handling of expired tokens (should refresh automatically)
- [ ] Test behavior when backend returns 401 (should redirect to login)

### 2. API Protection Tests
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with unauthorized requests (should return 401)
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with wrong role (should return 403)
- [ ] Test API endpoints with valid token but expired session
- [ ] Verify API security headers and CORS settings

### 3. UI Element Visibility Tests
- [ ] Verify navigation sidebar items are correctly shown/hidden by role
- [ ] Verify action buttons (edit, delete, etc.) are properly shown/hidden by permission
- [ ] Verify form fields are properly enabled/disabled by permission
- [ ] Verify dashboard widgets are correctly shown/hidden by role

### 4. Direct URL Access Tests
- [ ] Try accessing protected pages directly via URL when logged out (should redirect to login)
- [ ] Try accessing role-specific pages directly via URL when logged in as wrong role (should redirect)
- [ ] Try accessing company-specific resources from wrong company context (should fail)

### 5. Edge Case Tests
- [ ] Test behavior when a user's role is changed while they are logged in
- [ ] Test behavior when a user's company is changed while they are logged in
- [ ] Test behavior when a user's account is deactivated while they are logged in
- [ ] Test handling of users with no assigned company

## Mobile/Responsive Testing
- [ ] Verify authentication flow works correctly on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify permission-based UI adapts correctly on small screens
- [ ] Test session management on mobile browsers

## Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure authentication response times
- [ ] Test system behavior under high concurrent authenticated requests
- [ ] Verify token refresh mechanism doesn't impact user experience

## Security Testing
- [ ] Attempt common authentication bypass techniques
- [ ] Check for secure cookie settings (httpOnly, secure, SameSite)
- [ ] Verify JWT tokens are properly signed and validated
- [ ] Test for SQL injection in authentication-related queries
- [ ] Verify proper handling of CSRF tokens

## Test Execution Plan
1. Start with basic authentication tests for each role
2. Test role-specific functionality and permissions
3. Test edge cases and error conditions
4. Perform cross-cutting tests across roles
5. Document any issues found with detailed reproduction steps

## Test Environment Cleanup
- Reset any test data after testing
- Remove test accounts if not needed for future testing
- Document any persistent test data for reference

## Issue Tracking
- Track all found issues in the project issue tracker
- Categorize issues by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Include clear reproduction steps for each issue
- Track resolution of issues and verify fixes
