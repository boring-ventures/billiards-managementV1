# Phase 1: RBAC Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Updated Prisma Schema
We updated the Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) to add:
- A `Role` model with fields for ID, name, description, and JSON permissions
- A `DashboardSection` model to define different dashboard sections
- Added a `roleId` field to the `Profile` model that links to the new `Role` model
- Maintained the existing `role` enum field for backward compatibility

### 2. Created Database Migration
Due to challenges with Prisma's multiSchema feature, we created a direct SQL migration script (`sql/add_rbac_tables.sql`) that:
- Creates the `roles` table with appropriate fields
- Creates the `dashboard_sections` table
- Adds the `role_id` column to the `profiles` table
- Seeds initial role data with comprehensive permission structures
- Seeds dashboard section data
- Updates existing profiles to link to the appropriate role records

### 3. Implemented Core RBAC Utilities
Created a new utilities file (`src/lib/rbac-utils.ts`) with:
- Type definitions for permission structures
- `getUserRole()`: Function to get a user's role and permissions
- `isSuperAdmin()`: Function to check if a role is the SUPERADMIN role
- `hasPermission()`: Function to check if a user has permission for an action on a section
- `getEffectiveCompanyId()`: Function to determine the effective company ID for a user (with SUPERADMIN override capability)
- `hasCompanyAccess()`: Function to check if a user can access a specific company's data
- `hasApiPermission()`: Function to check if a user has permission to access an API endpoint

## Approach

We implemented a dual approach to ensure both backward compatibility and future extensibility:

1. **Current Implementation**: Uses the existing `UserRole` enum with hardcoded permissions
2. **Future Implementation**: Once the database migration is fully applied, we'll update the utilities to use the `Role` model with dynamic permissions from the database

The permission model follows a hierarchical structure:
```json
{
  "sections": {
    "sectionKey": {
      "view": true,
      "create": true,
      "edit": true,
      "delete": true
    }
  }
}
```

This allows for fine-grained control over what users can do in different sections of the application.

## Special Considerations

1. **SUPERADMIN Bypass**: SUPERADMIN users automatically bypass permission checks
2. **Company Scoping**: Regular users can only access their assigned company, while SUPERADMINs can access any company
3. **Backward Compatibility**: We maintained the existing role-based authorization system while adding the new RBAC system

## Next Steps

The utilities created in Phase 1 provide the foundation for the remaining phases:
- Phase 2: Standardize server-side client and cookie handling
- Phase 3: Implement RBAC enforcement in API routes
- Phase 4: Implement RBAC enforcement in client-side UI

To complete the migration to the new RBAC system, the database migration script needs to be run to create the necessary tables and seed the initial data.
